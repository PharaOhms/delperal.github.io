    <p>During my learning path I have taken many notes, I have built specific tools to facilitate my tasks and of course I have also used the tools, exploits, code snippets, and hundreds of resources provided by the community.<br>
They are very useful and you can find everything you need.</p>

    <h3> What is a hacker? </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>In general, people have a mistaken concept and totally removed from reality about the meaning of what a hacker is or how he acts, in part society, movies and series have been in charge of denigrating the sector since a person who does not have knowledge on the subject will be influenced and misinformed about the work and principles that hackers have.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="contents-left">
    <ul>
      <li>To begin with, I must clarify that unfortunately not all of us have the intention of taking advantage of our knowledge and skills to do good...<br>

          There are many definitions of what a hacker is but personally I feel identified with the following:<br>

          <br><li>A passionate, an enthusiast, an expert in new technologies, a person who tries to break the limits of technology to create something superior, who considers that making information available to everyone constitutes an extraordinary good.<br></li>
    </ul>
